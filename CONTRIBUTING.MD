## 🙋🏻‍♀️Contributing

We created the Tuva Project to be a place where healthcare data practitioners
can share their knowledge about doing healthcare analytics.  If you have ideas
for improvements or find bugs, we highly encourage and welcome feedback! Feel
free to create an issue or ping us on Slack.

For information on contributing, please see our [contributions guide](https://thetuvaproject.com/contributing).
